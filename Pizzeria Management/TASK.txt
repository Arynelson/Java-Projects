A program for managing a pizzeria that will be operated by the waiter.
The first step is to ask who is the waiter responsible for the order,
 we have 3 waiters (Sanclair, Gianni and Carol). then ask for the table 
number (from 1 to 28), if it is to take away, type 99, if the order is
 to take away ask for the address before ordering the pizzas. If it's 
not takeout, ask how many people will eat.
After starting to order pizzas, ask how many pizzas there will be and
 then the flavor, the available pizzas and their respective prices are:
- Peperoni - 8.5 euros
- 4 Formaggio - 9.5 euros
- Margherita - 7.5 euros
- Bacon - 9 euros
- Bont√° - 8 euros
- Vegetarian - 7 euros
- Al sea - 8.5 euros

If you don't have any pizza, skip to dessert

After ordering, ask how many drinks, these are the options:
- Beer - 4 euros
- aqua - 1 euro
- soda - 3.3 euros
- juice - 2.5 euros
- Spritz - 5 euros
If you don't have drinks, go straight to dessert

After asking how many desserts and if there are any, these are the options:

- tiramisu - 5.7 euros
- ice cream - 5 euros
If there is no dessert, go straight to reviewing your order

Print the order on the screen and ask if it is correct, if the answer is no, restart the program, if yes, show the bill amount.
Don't forget to add 4 euros for the delivery fee or 1 euro for each person to the bill.
